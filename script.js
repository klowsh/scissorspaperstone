// Project 1: Scissors Paper Stone

/* I am assigning a numerical value to scissors, paper and stone
- Scissors take on value 2
- Paper take on value 1
- Stone take on value 0
If value is equals to each other, it is a draw
This is so scissors can win paper, paper can win stone if their difference is 1
For stone to win scissors, will need -2 */
